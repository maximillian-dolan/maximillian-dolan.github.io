I am currently studying for a Master's in Scientific Programming and Data Science at the University of Bristol, having recently graduated from there with a joint-honours Bachelors's of science in Physics and Philosophy. Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I further developed my strong mathematical ability, while also gaining practical problem-solving skills and an ability to understand and assess complex abstract issues. These are skills that I continued to build on during my postgraduate work, in which I gained practical experience in programming, particuarly within machine learning, data analysis and co-operative software development
